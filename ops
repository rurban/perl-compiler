Here we have main, and you didn't provide a main.xs. So please leave that cargo cult non-sense out.\n\n2nd: B::C does not store stashes, unless you want to keep them with -fstash. \nBut do store subs as GV but not more.\n\nThe case here: The CvNAME is static. Delete does not change the name to **ANON** as there's no \nstash magic on deletion going on here. fooref is still called foo. \nThis is a feature.\n\nSo the reduced example would be:\np -e'my @c; sub foo { @c = caller(0); print $c[3] } my $fooref = delete $::{foo}; $fooref -\u003e ();' =\u003e main::**ANON**\nvs pcc =\u003e main::foo","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"dc64d6d260e2683565fe6e13d60cfbe9fec0fa09"},"timestamp":1426277966,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MzQwNTg5","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/perl-compiler/issues/184#issuecomment-79340589"},"message":"Comment [#2](https://code.google.com/p/perl-compiler/issues/detail?id=182#c2) originally posted by rurban on 2013-11-12T17:13:21.000Z:\n\nIssue 187 has been merged into this issue.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"dc64d6d260e2683565fe6e13d60cfbe9fec0fa09"},"timestamp":1426277970,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MzQwNjc4","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/perl-compiler/issues/184#issuecomment-79340678"},"message":"Comment [#3](https://code.google.com/p/perl-compiler/issues/detail?id=182#c3) originally posted by rurban on 2013-11-18T20:13:15.000Z:\n\nIssue 190 has been merged into this issue.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"dc64d6d260e2683565fe6e13d60cfbe9fec0fa09"},"timestamp":1426277972,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUyNTY4NjAw"},"status":2}]}
