And in both cases it\nwas stomping on PL_linestr (the current line buffer) while\nPL_sublex_info.re_eval_start was pointing to an offset in that buffer.\n(re_eval_start is used to construct the string to include in the\nregexpâ€™s stringification once the lexer reaches the end of the\nre-eval.)\n\nFixing this entails moving re_eval_start and re_eval_str to\nPL_parser-\u003elex_shared, making the pre-localised values visible.\nThis is so that the code that peeks into an outer linestr buffer to\nsteal the here-doc body can set up re_eval_str in the right scope.\n(re_eval_str is used to store the re-eval text when the here-\noc parser has no choice but to modify linestr; see also commit\ndb4442662555874019.)\n\nIt also entails making the stream-based parser (i.e., that reads from\nan input stream) leave PL_linestr alone, instead of clobbering it and\nthen reconstructing part of it afterwards.\n```","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"10c623ced12a685284188dc5ea89cffce509dd3d"},"timestamp":1444174989,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjAzNTQ0MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/perl-compiler/issues/222#issuecomment-146035440"},"message":"showed up in v5.17.10","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"10c623ced12a685284188dc5ea89cffce509dd3d"},"timestamp":1446148566,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NDQ5NjcyODA0"},"added":[],"removed":["CoreTests.522"]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"10c623ced12a685284188dc5ea89cffce509dd3d"},"timestamp":1446148602,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ0OTY3MzM2MQ=="},"added":["CoreTests.522"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"10c623ced12a685284188dc5ea89cffce509dd3d"},"timestamp":1446151062,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjMxMTE5OA==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/perl-compiler/issues/222#issuecomment-152311198"},"message":"./t/testc.sh 222","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"10c623ced12a685284188dc5ea89cffce509dd3d"},"timestamp":1446760734,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ1NjI3OTM0Ng=="},"added":["Priority-Medium"],"removed":[]}]}
