We have no caller info since we freeze/thaw the state after BEGIN, when the bootstrap call was already made, and we have no caller information for this call. We successfully faked it until 5.15.3 in dl_init(), now we use our private XSLoader::load_file() which BTW also does not check .bs files. \n.bs files were only needed for very old sunos installations. And should be fixed in Configure and DynaLoader globally, not for every single XSUB.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"dc64d6d260e2683565fe6e13d60cfbe9fec0fa09"},"timestamp":1426203067,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjkxMDMy","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/perl-compiler/issues/79#issuecomment-78691032"},"message":"Comment [#2](https://code.google.com/p/perl-compiler/issues/detail?id=77#c2) originally posted by rurban on 2011-10-17T17:27:22.000Z:\n\nFull workaround and fix added with r1196.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"dc64d6d260e2683565fe6e13d60cfbe9fec0fa09"},"timestamp":1426203069,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUxNDIxNjY3"},"status":2}]}
