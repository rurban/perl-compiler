Otherwise a run-time require will fail to include the module at run-time, because it is assumed it is already compiled in.\n\nErrno and Tie::Hash::NamedCapture should be included analog to core, if special symbols main::! + and - are saved, and removed if not.\n\nExporter,Exporter::Heavy,Config,Config_heavy,Config_git,... are pulled in by the compiler, but sometimes not saved.\n\nThis will probably also fix issues 84 and 85.","files":null}]}
