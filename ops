All keys which can lead to this vulnerability, \n%ENV and object fields mainly.\n\nNot vulnerable:\nPL_strtab = which are shared HEK's like CvPROTO, GvNAME, GvFILE, bareword hash keys.\n\nStashes? Package names and %INC should generally not be vulnerable, \nso the hash can be compile-time.\n\n%ENV and all other hashes should be reseeded at init.","files":null}]}
