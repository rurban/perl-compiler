(20-30 min)\n\nEnhance the package scanner (like --no-includeall) to skip external linkable modules, \ncompile and link them seperately. \nLinkable modules are created with -m.\n\nUse the perlcc -m option to do this for any script / module.\n  -m \u0026quot;modularize\u0026quot; if .pl, check deps also, and update -m modules if necessary.
