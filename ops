I do not want to scan code for such cases as it cannot be generalized what the author wants. compile-time automatically deferred to run-time? Na.\n\nThe module author should use an INIT or UNITCHECK block for this code. It would change nothing for uncompiled code but makes it clear when it should be executed.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"dc64d6d260e2683565fe6e13d60cfbe9fec0fa09"},"timestamp":1426203013,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUxNDIwNzU5"},"status":2}]}
