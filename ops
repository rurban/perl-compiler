Two new classes, B::PADNAME and B::PADNAMELIST, have been introduced.\n\nThe PADNAME and PADNAMELIST types are now separate types, and no longer simply aliases for SV and AV. [perl #123223].\n\nPad names are now always UTF-8. The PadnameUTF8 macro always returns true. Previously, this was effectively the case already, but any support for two different internal representations of pad names has now been removed.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"dc64d6d260e2683565fe6e13d60cfbe9fec0fa09"},"timestamp":1436994612,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTc0ODQ2OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/perl-compiler/issues/204#issuecomment-121748469"},"message":"Yes, 5.22 is not yet supported.
