	Started on CPAN with B-C-1.04_12
	The Perl compiler was in CORE from alpha4 until Perl 5.9.4 and worked 
	quite fine with Perl 5.6 and 5.8

	Almost fixed evaltry (12) with proper cop_seq setup, just solaris and debian
	fail sometimes. Tested ok with strawberry 5.10.1

	* C.pm: fixed evaltry (test 12) mostly, NVX was shared with 2 xpad_cop_seq ints
	  which accidently just worked before 1.17 with %s, but not after changing 
	  to the %g representation.
	Ignore unused random (overlong) xpviv IV, causing
	  "warning: this decimal constant is unsigned only in ISO C90"
	Defer rv => cv to run-time < 5.10. Fixes ExtUtils::Install

	  -s a, exitcode 0, ok, no warnings on stderr
	* t/TESTS: added 38, failing on CC (Nick Koston).

	add -sharedxs, -sharedlib; -shared is now for shared linkage, 
	  -sharedlib to create a shared lib (was -shared before but never worked),
	  -sharedxs to also link shared xsubs, no run-time DynaLoader/XSLoader needed.

1.09	2009-12-27 rurban
	* C.pm: Cut down the number of AUTOLOAD'ed optrees, search only on 
	  empty gv->cv (31).
	Added very unsafe -O4/-fcop to eliminate most cops and file + line numbers.

	* C.pm: Had to disable -O1 -fcog (pv_copy_on_grow) on 5.10 and higher
	  until I find out how to fool S_unshare_hek_or_pvn. This fixes all C
	  -O1 and -O2 tests. Warn about this.

1.04_30 2009-12-13 rurban
	Better 5.6 support, but Bytecode compiler still disabled.
	Not even the Byteloader works for 5.6 assembled code. The Disassembler 
	does not stop at ret. Fixed several C tests.

	* bytecode.pl: renumbering policy: <= 5.6 squeeze, >= 5.8 fixed
	to force exact bytecode numbering as with 5.8.

	Added logic to include all possible unsupported ops, all holes.
	bytecode table checked for 5.6.1, 5.6.2, 5.8.0, 5.8.1-5.11
	Note, that I found official and contradicting 5.6.1 releases. 
	ActiveState 5.6.1.626 had no op_children, the unix release tarball 
	with 5.6.1 (called Trial 1) still has it.
	
	* ByteLoader.pm (1.06_06): better bytecode numbering.
	* Asmdata.pm (1.02_02): strict numbering along 5.8.

	CORE compiler.
	* disassemble: Make it work with the older Disassembler.
	Make it work with older bytecode >= 5.8 via Asmdata unsupported ops.
	* i386.xs, jitcompiler.pl: removed (seperate module)
	* bytecode.h, C.xs: Fixed for 5.6, tested with 5.6.1 with MSVC.
	* bytecode.h, byterun.c: add static int force = 0. Override it to 1 to 
	try out executing older bytecodes.

	* C.pm: fix test 16 on 5.10 again, non-threaded only (GVAV magic). 
	  first fix in 1.04_24, broken in 1.04_28. On 5.11 I have a broken 
	  RV handling here.
	Remove version and Regexp::DESTROY from the automatic methods 
	(experimental).
	First attempts with pv and hek consting failed.
	* t/testc.sh, t/testplc.sh: support proper cmdline arguments, add -h for 
	help
	Fixed test 5 by fixing the wrong test.
	* perloptree.pod: renamed from perloptreeguts.pod. Added links.

1.04_29 2009-12-07 rurban
	Disable the Bytecode compiler for 5.6. Fixed besides the __DATA__ handle 
	  (test 15) all remaining 5.8 C bugs.
	* C.pm: assign the PVX of GV also for empty stashes (main::) to avoid 
	  destruction failures at Perl_pad_undef() SvPVX_const(namesv) == '&'. 
	Fixes tests 14 and 23
	* byterun.c: No assert on empty bs_sv, it is &PL_sv_undef.
	Map missing -Dv on 5.6 to -Df i.e. -D256
	Added better debugging output: setter values.
	* STATUS: re-run CORE tests, list cmdlines, update status
	* Disassembler.pm: added gen_header_hash() for gen_header output. 
	  add to documentation.
	* Bytecode.pm: -S uses gen_header_hash for gen_header output.

1.04_28 2009-12-06 rurban
	* C.pm: fix -fcog (Copy on Grow with -O1 and -O2) for >= 5.10 by a new 
	  SVPV. 
	Statically initialize PVs with a union layout trick. Use char* as first 
	  union member. 
	Revert xpvcv+svsect changes to pre-initialize those structs against 
	  gvcv recursion. 
	* t/b.t, t/o.t, t/stash.t: fix tests for 5.6.2
	* bytecode.c: byteorder swab only if same length. 
	1234 => 4321, 12345678 => 87654321.
	Skip a 0x prefix for byteorder in the header. Perl 5.6 had this. 
	* Assembler.pm (0.07_06): 5.6 byteorder fix: until 5.6 the 
	  $Config{byteorder} was falsely dependent on ivsize, we need longsize.
	Add 0x to byteorder in header again, as with 5.6.
	* t/testc.sh: do not run old leftovers. some 5.6 optimizations
	* t/c_o1.t, t/c_o2.t, t/cc_o2.t, t/cc_o2.t: added

    Subject: [PATCH 5.004_61] bunch of small patches

Nick Ing-Simmons <nick@ing-simmons.net>  1998-02-28 11:31:15
    Missed FREAD in bytecode.h
    Cannot export svref_mutex in non-threaded perl

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-27 18:35:27
    Change FREAD/FGETC to BGET_FREAD/BGET_FGETC to avoid clash with
    preprocessor symbol on Digital UNIX.

Gurusamy Sarathy <gsar@cpan.org>  1998-02-26 03:56:19
    [win32] various cleanups so that B can be built as "just another extension"
     - export symbols needed for building B
     - bset_obj_store() is needed by byterun(), so define it there instead
       of at B.xs, and export it
     - freadpv() is only used in B.xs, so move it there
     - byte*.h are now included by perl.h
     - regenerate embed*.h

Gurusamy Sarathy <gsar@cpan.org>  1998-02-22 02:40:56
    [win32] get compiler building under win32 (needed Makefile.PL
    hacks that could be applicable to other platforms)

    More compiler tweaks.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 18:23:47
    Remove compiler files from their old lib/B locations. The compiler
    now builds by default (without the byteperl executable so far) and
    seems to work at least minimally.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 18:05:33
    Move lib/B/... and lib/[BO].pm over to where they should be,
    under ext/B.
    
Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 17:54:58
    Start getting compiler to work when built with the core.
    [Still won't work as of this change.]

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 16:42:13

	* Merge perlext/Compiler/... into mainline. Some files move to
    ext/B/..., some to lib/B/..., O.pm and B.pm go in lib and some
    move to the base perl directory (e.g. headers). Will need some
    cleaning up before it builds properly, I would guess.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 16:39:38
	* [compiler] Win32 changes from Sarathy, tweaked slightly by me.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-17 17:50:50
	* Assorted changes to the compiler

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-12-17 10:59:40
	* Fix typo in compiler B/C.pm.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-12-10 18:33:53
	Alpha5
	* Start overhauling compiler. It was working at least minimally
    right up until the final tweak of B.xs to add threadsv_names
    at which point building it provokes a seg fault in perl while
    doing the xsubpp :-(.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-09-03 12:31:48
	* Make compiler build/work with devel 5.005

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-07-05 11:58:05  
	* Change %lx to %x in B::CV::save to prevent some CV
    fields becoming 0 in the init section. Add missing
    write_back in B::Stackobj::Padsv::load_double to fix
    test 22 of op/my.t.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-07-05 11:58:05 
	* B::CC::pp_padsv must cope with vivify_ref (5.004)
	  as well as provide_ref (5.003)

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-05-03 14:47:06  
	Alpha 4
	* initial check in of compiler
	from version Alpha a3 to a4
