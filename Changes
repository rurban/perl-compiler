	and worked quite fine with Perl 5.6 and 5.8.

1.54 2015-12-?? rurban
        * C: Fix defined for RV since 5.20 and ithreads (#354)
        Fix anon functions in INIT block (#352) (atoomic)
        Fix C.xs for old non-c99 compilers. i.e. msvc6
        Fix segfault from PVMG (#348) (atoomic), regression added
          for match once

1.53 2015-12-05 rurban
        added 5.22 support, some cperl optimizations and fixed most remaining 5.14 issues.
        Bytecode broken upstream with 5.22.0

        * Bytecode (1.17): removed lastsib bit for 5.21.2-5.21.10, support only moresib op
        Add ops for padl, padn, padnl, unop_aux and methop needed for 5.22
        ByteLoader was broken upstream with 5.22. You need to build a perl with
        `perlall build --patches-Compiler 5.22.0` or use cperl5.22.2.
        Added a probe, set $B::C::Flags::have_byteloader
        * Disassembler (1.13), Assembler (1.13): support PADNAME and PADNAMELIST for 5.22
        * C: fix B::PMOP::precomp for UTF8 (#333, #338, GH#50)
        Add 5.22 support with a new unop_aux (multideref) section, methop support,
          new support for PADNAME and PADNAMELIST objects.
        Removed B::Section which used base. (toddr)
        Re-add PL_sv_objcount on cperl
        Fixed XSUB CONSTSUB alias (44,45,... PR #228) (atoomic)
          and anonymous CVs for 5.22 (#246, #305)
        Proper utf8 support for gv_fetchpv, gv_stashpv and cv_get,
          cache gv_stashpv calls.
        Fix 5.22 for empty hash keys, share_hek("") (272, GH#249)
        Fixed refcounts for shared hek's, fixing the notorious unshare_hek assertions
          since 5.10 (GH #251, #255). See 1.06: "Had to disable -O1 -fcog (pv_copy_on_grow)
          on 5.10 and higher until I find out how to fool S_unshare_hek_or_pvn. This fixes
          all C -O1 and -O2 tests. Warn about this."
        Fix Inf/NaN support for C (GH#287)
        Fix handling of READONLY hashes in 5.22, i.e. use feature (GH#250)
        Support custom op Devel_Peek_Dump, added with 5.20 (GH#274)
        Defer regex compilation to new init1 for SWASHNEW (GH#273)
        Support unicode labels (upstream B bug) (GH#318)
        Skip unneeded init-time lexwarn checks,
          support optimized cperl PERL_SUPPORT_STATIC_COP (cperl #70)
        Fixed overload stringify broken since 5.18 (GH #219)
          by adding a mro_isa_changed_in() to the overloaded stash.
        Support multiple stash ENAMES, needed since 5.14 (GH #331)
          This fixed many old 5.14 limitations. (Added to our version of B)
        Support %^H, storing the hints_hash (features, pragmas) (GH#220)
          This fixed many old 5.14 limitations.
        Improve MATCH once (m??) handling with reset, find PMOP from
          the Regexp dynamically (GH#252)
        Bump refcounts of dynamic get_cv refs (#293). Fixes Coro in global destruction.
        Fix upstream B::UNOP_AUX::aux_list bug with threads. Use our own method which
          returns the PADOFFSET, not the SV. (#341)
        * CC (1.16_01): Encode unicode labels (GH#318)
        * Stackobj (1.12_01): fix Inf/NaN support for CC (GH#287)
        * t/CORE: versioned the core tests and moved to a external submodule
          perl11/p5-coretests on github. (GH#332)

1.52 2014-09-09 rurban
        * C: Protect against empty SV ptr in SV magic (\0) with $` with 5.20 (#370)
        Save new pmop (?{}) code_list with 5.18 (#372)
	Unset PL_use_safe_putenv as in perlmain, which initializes PL_origalen properly,
	  which fixes setting long a $0 string (#194)
        Force Moose when only Class::MOP is loaded to give the needed path hint to XSLoader,
          when "Assuming xs loaded $stashname".
        * t/test.pl: print @cmd with TEST_VERBOSE

1.51 2014-08-04 rurban
        * C: boot_EV (analog to Coro) SvREADONLY_off its XS symbols (#368)

1.50 2014-07-23 rurban
        * C: fix DBI, special case DBI_MAGIC, call DBI->_install_method to
          re-initialize compile-time internal ima pointers (#359)
        Skip saving %IO::Handle for *STDOUT, which bloated 5.18 (#361)
        Fix XS boot of Class::MOP without Moose, and generalize it to other
          xs-loaded modules, which just call bootstrap Module. (#350, #364)
        Earlier xs_init for Encode similar to attributes (hack, fixes #32 regression)
        Use the system malloc for data being system free'd: cop_warnings,
          PMOP->op_pv, sv_debug_file, needed for certain DEBUGGING options.
          Fixes Attribute::Handler free errors (#362)
        Strip binary BM chunk from comppad names < 5.8.8 (#363)
        Save some CvXSUBANY values, esp. relocate any_ptr if possible:
          POSIX::is*, DBI, List::MoreUtils::*_iterator.
          The any_i32 values are already set in the boot section of the XS.
        Fixed initialization of foreign Encodings (#365),
          fixed initialization of old Encode versions < 2.58 also (#305)
        * CC (1.16): Strip binary BM chunk from comppad names (CC names) < 5.8.8 (#363)
        * perlcc (2.20): Strip wrong version-less -I<site_perl> (#366)
        * Makefile.PL: Install into archlib on 5.8 and 5.6 (#358)

1.49 2014-07-12 rurban
        * C: Changed IO::Socket::SSL warning to recommend >= 1.995.
          1.996 even has some perlcc specific usage documentation (#317)
        Fix PerlIO::scalar XS bootstrap forced by __DATA__ (#360)
          We sometimes missed it

1.48 2014-07-11 rurban
        Fixed C walker and 5.18-5.20 Bytecode.
        This is the major version which cPanel will use for 5.14.4. With the next
        versions we'll start working on -m and buildcc, to split packages into shared libs.
        And use B::CC and/or rperl compiled modules selectively.

        * C: Make revised -fwalkall the default. Fixes missing dumped method-only packages (#348)
        Always save all user-loaded packages. Skip only compiler-loaded packages if
          not used by user code. The compiler loads and dumps now additionally only the
          heavy parts for utf8 and bytes, and utf8 for m///i, and AnyDBM for dbmopen,
          PerlIO::Scalar for __DATA__ handles, and Coro::State::_jit if required, but
          nothing else.
        Fix for missing RTLD_NOLOAD on BSD, needed for run-time remap of compile-time
          XS symbols via dlsym (#351)
        Special-case XS loading of Moose.xs from Class::MOP (#350)
        Better fix for mult. match once by checking OP_MATCH with ONCE flags in C.xs also (#274)
          but there are still some platforms without pmop->op_pmregexp in the C.xs detection runloop
        Add op_lastsib bit for 5.21.2
        Changed IO::Socket::SSL warning as our patch was rejected upstream.
          Need to maintain now a fork cPanel::IO::Socket::SSL to be able to use compiled
          IO::Socket::SSL servers. (#317)
        * Stackobj (1.12): Harmonize RV checks (fixes cc 105 -O1 and -O2)
        * Bytecode (1.16): Replace each %hash with foreach keys in walksymtable also (#307)
        Do not store main_cv->START, empty optree since 5.18
        Add op_lastsib for 5.21.2, but sort still broken with PERL_OP_PARENT
        * Assembler (1.12): error if a PUT method misses an argument
        * perlcc (2.19): -B produces again -H bytecode, runnable without -MByteLoader.
        Fix default output name from a.outexe to a.exe on a windows-based OS.
        * Makefile.PL: fix installation of cc_runtime.h for B::CC

1.47 2014-06-11 rurban
        Fixed Bytecode for 5.18. Fully support 5.18 and 5.20 now.
        Greatly reduce code size for C and esp. CC, by including less unneeded dependencies.

	* C: detect new Encode >2.58 compile-time usage (#305, RT #94221)
        Fix mro maybe::next:: detection (#326)
        Fix %INC cleanup logic. Delete packages from %INC only if they were really not saved,
          and add packages to %INC which were saved and not just marked for saving. (#340)
          Fix lot of skip package logic and consistency parts. Much less packages are now saved
          in general which leads to smaller and faster code.
          Avoid compile-time compiler internal reloads and redefinitions.
        Special-case %warning::Bits on -O3 to not SEGV when changing warnings on run-time loads
          on compile-time saved -fconst-string warnings.
        Add experimental -fwalkall to add all wanted packages recursively with maxdepth 3.
          No tests yet.
        Add time and version on top of C source code. Also for CC.
        Fix lexical subs for threaded perls (#130, #341)
        Add special fixes for Coro: reload Coro jit and SvREADONLY_off some of its XS symbols (#293)
        Fix "Eval-group not allowed at runtime" errors since 5.18 (#135),
          by settting HINT_RE_EVAL for re-eval groups when compiling the QR
        Fix for readonly magic hashes, usually found since 5.20 (#273)
        Fix Can't locate object method "bootstrap_inherit" via package "DynaLoader" (#125)
          again, as the improved walker now strips DynaLoader from simple one-liners like
          'use Clone' and the DynaLoader detection was too late. Do it now earlier.
	* ByteLoader (0.11): fixed filter -H problem with 5.18 (#339)
          Disabling the PerlIO_binmode(PL_RSFP, IoTYPE_RDONLY, O_BINARY, 0); hack for [perl #86186]
          "Changing filters to be textmode, not binary" fixed the Bytecode problems since 5.18
	* perlcc (2.18): Avoid -H for bytecode > 5.18
	New --check option
	* t/asmdata.t: signicant enhancements
        * t/CORE: add mro and re core tests, only mro/isarev.t is unstable, and several re-eval
          tests using variables are skipped and unsupported.

1.46 2014-05-14 rurban
	Added global destruction, improved -O4 and CC, fixed mro, @-, $/ $\, Net::DNS, ...
        Added mro and re core testsuite.

	* C: reset PL_stack_sp on init (was one too far). no effects on code.
	Implement global destruction via sv_clean_objs and my_curse on -O3, resp.
	  prepend static svs PL_sv_arenaroot for sv_clean_objs with a fake sv_list[0].
	  (#197, #208, #254, #280)
	Call DESTROY methods for all our global static SVs (i.e. "global destruction"),
	  fixes #197, #280, #282
	Increment GV->FORM refcounts as they cannot be destructed, analog to CV
	Call PL_exitlist functions with -O3
	Make the lexical cop_warnings pointer dynamic, because on cv_undef (scope exit,
	  assign, exit, die, ...) CvROOT and all its kids are freed, ignoring op_latefreed.
	  The content of the warning is still a static string - and leaks on perl, but
	  we don't care.
	-fwarn-sv is now always set, just not with MSVC on Windows. The warnings are then
	  directly set, not in a tight loop afterwards, because the value is needed for
	  the dynamic init.
        Fixed lexical warnings on 5.8 (pWARN_STD .. pWARN_NONE)
	Improve -O4 by keeping all CvSTART cops
	Keep internal packages if used in the source code, e.g. mro (#300)
	Fix the order of PerlIO_cleanup, after global destruction (#302, #303)
	Since 5.18 padlists are now all dynamic, due to undef issues in non-local exits (#304)
	Add -fno-dyn-padlist to -O4 to keep static padlists on 5.18.
	  Dynamic padlists are needed to prevent from cv_undef crashes on static padlists
	  when cleaning up the stack on non-local exits, like die or exit or subs on the
	  compile stack as with Attribute::Handler (#169, #304). Previously only END block
	  function padlists were dynamic (#298).
	Add run-time remap of compile-time XS symbols via dlsym (#305, RT #94069)
	  Net::DNS includes Encode::XS ascii_encoding, but also init the 3 other encoding ptrs.
          Add a fast path for d_dlopen + i_dlfcn systems (i.e. Windows goes the slow init2 route)
	Detect new Encode-2.58 which stores encodings better to handle proper
          compile-time usage (#305, RT #94221)
	Add special SV associations for $/, $@ and $\ (#306, #256)
	Save @ISA for all included packages, esp. DynaLoader dependencies (#308)
        Replace each %hash with foreach sort keys (#307)
	Set ${^GLOBAL_PHASE} with -O3 for END and DESTRUCT (#197, #208)
	Do not store invalid GvCV symbols, only cv or &sv_list entries (#313)
	Support GvFORM pseudo CVs (B::FM objects) on 5.10 (#149)
	Support local $/ = "somestring" (only used empty values before) (#314),
          A regression from 1.43
	Support local $\ = "somestring" (#318), also a regression from 1.43
	Fix special 5.6. associations for $, $\ as they are no SVs there (#306)
        Fix wrong caching of internal LEXWARN symbols (#322)
        Warn on bad IO::Socket::SSL versions 1.956-1.983 which would SEGV if used as server (#317)
        Support __DATA__ blocks in packages without printing wrong warnings (#310)
	Support ->(maybe|next)::(method|can) mro method calls (#324, #301)
	Support mro c3 (#316)
	Support @- @LAST_MATCH_START, the array of the last submatches (#281, #220, #295)
	Workaround a 5.18 de-optimization which disabled ++PL_sv_objcount on bless
	  by adding it if a DESTROY method exists. This will fail since 5.18 if DESTROY
	  is added at run-time. (#208, #197)
        Add new init0 section to initialize -fppaddr ops before init, not afterwards. (#330)
          Needed to call utf8::SWASHINIT at init with CALLREGCOMP and /i
        Avoid duplicate PL_utf8_tofold ToCf swash initialization with 5.18 (#330)
	* CC (1.15): Skip saving non-existing methods analog to B::C 1.43_06 (CC test 50)
	Fix failing CopFILE_free and CopSTASH_free in END blocks with threads (#296, CC test 48)
	Handle duplicate function names, like multiple END blocks or anon functions (#297)
        Replace each %hash with foreach sort keys (#307)
        * Bytecode (1.15): Replace each %hash with foreach keys (#307)
	* Bblock (1.04): Do not pollute B::CC (find_leaders) with B::Concise

1.45	2014-02-11 rurban
	* t/issue281.t: fix wrong test ($[ vs $])

1.44	2014-02-10 rurban
	added adjusted CORE testsuite for 5.14. passes for 5.14.4-nt, not for 5.18.2-nt
	(cPanel code_monkeys)
	still missing in general are:
	  - global destruction (use lexicals!),
	  - attribute handlers,
	  - compile-time perlio layers

	* C: Fix -O3 with ~ and ~~ formatstrings (#277)
	Fix SvLEN and PV ptr for empty shared hash keys (#272)
	Use the natural @dl_modules boot order, just put attributes to the front (#259)
	Store cop_hints to support lexical numeric hints pragmas,
	  esp. use bytes and use open attributes
	  (fixes #81 #152 #174 #176 #180 #185 #224 #235 #238 #241 #245 #253 #255 #256 #277)
	Skip saving defined(&cv) subs (#96)
	Fix format STDOUT/STDERR (#238, #239, #277, #284, #285, #283)
	Save now empty bodyless subs if they exist, for signal handlers,
	  prototypes declarations and cvrefs (#251, #159, #235, #246, #270, #271, #275, #279)
	Fix PVMG PV overwriting the RV, overload sub (#273)
	* CC (1.14): Skip saving non-existing methods analog to B::C 1.43_06 (CC test 50)
	* perlcc (2.17): Accept -A for -DALLOW_PERL_OPTIONS
	* t/testc.sh: Accept -A for -DALLOW_PERL_OPTIONS

1.43	2014-01-15 rurban
	new 5.16, and partial 5.18, 5.20 and windows support.
	Many more fixes and testcases.
	Bytecode is still broken on 5.18, esp non-threaded. 5.20 looks pretty good though.

	* C: Fix -u<module> without file extension.
	With hek do not drop FAKE, only for const pv.
	Fixed $$ ($PID) to be dynamic, issue 108. Thanks to flexvault for reporting this.
	Fixed double precision to 16 digits. The nbody shootout test passes now.
	Fixed refcounts of *ENV, issue 111.
	Fixed wrong boot_ arg for the xs version check with --staticxs
	Better fix for overwriting of @ARGV <O3, test c_argv:1 and c_allow_opts.t:1
	Fixed refinition warnings of XS CONSTSUB. Ignore them as they are
	  loaded later.
	Add $dlmodule::VERSION as 2nd arg to boot_$dlmodule resp. $dlmodule::bootstrap
	  to get rid of the pesky Invalid version format error in xs_version_bootcheck
	  if the $VERSION had already version magic attached. (no testcase, hard to repro)
	perl 5.16.0 shipped a slightly broken B without cop_stashlen. As workaround
	  we do not support utf8 stashes nor null bytes in stashes on 5.16.0 threaded.
	Fixed Null COP storage for 5.16 and 5.17
	Fix amagic_generation which was removed with 5.17
	Fix ALLOW_PERL_OPTIONS: add -e behind all processed options, not before
	Fixed HvAUX init. Previously only with magic hashes, now on all OOK hashes (OOK+SHAREKEYS)
	  e.g. %warning::Bits
	Added support for new PADLIST type since 5.17.4 (with xpadl_id) and 5.17.6 (without)
	$^X returns now the real executable name, not just perl or perl.exe
	Adjust COW string lengths to hold the COW_REFCNT byte at the end
	Fix unicode string CUR and LEN (#142, #162)
	Fix unicode hashkeys (HEK) mostly (#200), but not yet testc.sh 2001 (compile-time
	  stored utf8 heks)
	Save HvTOTALKEYS at run-time as max added to the number of run-time added keys (#178)
	Fix UV uvuformat on 32bit -Duse64bitint (#145)
	op_pmreplstart is now run-time initialized >= 5.10 (#160)
	Fixed special usage of magic vars @-,@+,%+,$-,$! (#90)
	Fixed wrong REGEXP length for compiled QR data (#143)
	Fixed wrong -O3 comparison of strings to numbers (#138,#141, branch new-cog), unified
	  PV handling, disabled -fcog replaced by -O3 -fconst-strings
	Fixed NUL-byte handling in strings by using B::SV->PV instead of PVX (#237)
	Storing now bareword filehandles (#148,#149)
	Do not create GvGP at all. This also removes the need for newGP() (Windows/AIX)
	use Config does not include B anymore, Internals::V now in __ANON__ package
	Fixed handling of empty - not successfully autoloaded - CVs (#235, #159, ...)
	  by storing the SV and XPVCV but ignoring it and defer to run-time get_cv()
	Unify handling of static and dynamic strings, use ptr_undef throughout instead
	  of NULL vs &PL_sv_undef (save_pv_or_rv => savesym, cur, len, pv, static)
	Restore $^H, the numeric value of global warnings flags (#193,#207,#243)
	Restore more missing globals: ${^UNICODE} ${^UTF8LOCALE} $; $\ $, $/ $" $|
	  $^A $^L $: $^H $^R $% $- $= if set in a BEGIN block or via cmdline (#256,#231)
	Restore even deprecated vars $] $# $* (#171)
	Fix HvAUX memory corruption, accessing HvAUX beyond HE fields, esp. with threaded perls.
	  Initialize now HvAUX backref and mro_meta fields.
	Do not boot internal core XS packages twice, refer to internal XS functions dynamically
	  and do not link to them. Fixes fix Windows/AIX with strict linking.
	Defer dynaloaded GvCV initialization after dl_init()
	Fixed storage of non-special lexical warnings (#258 warnsize-i258)
	Fixed storage of shared heks, support IsCOW_hek (i.e. method names)
	Support new ReANY since 5.17.6 (#258 reg_temp_copy)
	Support stash symtab magic for PMf_ONCE m?? and reset (#188)
	Fixed POSIX overflow constants warnings for DBL_MAX,DBL_MIN,LONG_MIN,LONG_MAX (#262)

	Set PadnamelistMAXNAMED(comppad_name) needed since 5.19.3 for eval string (#268)
	Add new option -fno-delete-pkg to control if to ignore compiler-only dependent packages,
	  compiler-independent packages are now always saved. Save those package names at Makefile.PL
	  in @B::C::Flags::deps.

	* perlcc (2.14): new option --dryrun, -v5 does not -Dsp,-v
	 new option -f passthru to C and CC
	* perlcc (2.15): fixed default --spawn: use waitpid which was broken for parallel builds.
	fixed warning Prototype mismatch: sub main::gettimeofday: none vs () at perlcc line 261
	improved --version
	added --perlopts to handle -DALLOW_PERL_OPTIONS
	* perlcc (2.16): changed output name rules:
	Without given output file name we use the name of the input file (in the subdir)
	or with -e a.out resp. a.exe and a randomized intermediate C filename.
	If the input file is an absolute path on non-windows systems use the basename.
	* CC (1.13): Use the B::C integer and double precision logic (ivx, nvx).
	Fixed double precision to 16 digits. The nbody shootout is now 2x faster than perl.
	Added optimizations: -fno-magic, -fno-autovivify, -faelem
	Detect "no autovivification;" pragma.
	New -fno-taint, -fomit_taint is deprecated
	Fix amagic_generation which was removed with 5.17
	Use new perl6 type names: int, num, str. double and string are deprecated.

	* ByteLoader (0.10): set sv_refcnt to 1 in newsv to skip most defaults
	* Assembler (1.11): allow "newpadlx 0"
	* Disassembler (1.12): use B::Concise op_flags and private_flags
	* Stash (1.03): fix compilation for 5.8.8 and below: gv_fetchsv missing
	* t/perldoc.t: perlcc fails with 5.8 because Cwd disturbs the
	  fragile method package finder for File::Spec. Use cc_harness.

1.42	2012-02-01 rurban
	stable up to 5.14

	* C: Improved finding methods in parent classes (Warning: method not found),
	Save @ISA of those child classes.
	Re-implement and simplify my_share_hek, now in terms of share_hek.
	  PL_strtab hack gone. This fixed the shared_hek destruction
	  problems.
	Turn off CvDYNFILE needed since 5.15.4, use static CvFILE. (DateTime)
	* perlcc: perlcc -stash does not hang anymore, renabled t/e_perlcc.t -stash section
	* Stash (1.02): '-xs' does not load B anymore.
	  Now in seperate directory Stash
	* Stash/Stash.xs: new with CvIsXSUB() to get rid of B, polluting the stashes.

1.41	2012-01-30 rurban
	* t/modules.t: Fixed syntax error

1.40	2012-01-30 rurban
	static PerlIO Layers (e.g. __DATA__)

	* C: fixed deferred %INC, %INC is now stored and cleaned up at the end.
	Improved __DATA__ handle  as PerlIO layer, PerlIO::scalar now
	  loaded static (test 15).
	Defer eval section after dl_init (e.g. for PerlIO::scalar) (test 15)
	Check for XSLoader now at the very end (test 27)
	Fixed MUTABLE_CV for 5.10.0
	Improved 5.8 method lifting for not-found methods a bit (5.8. perldoc.t)
	* Bytecode: fixed test 22
	  Cannot locate object method "fileno" via package "IO::File"
	* Makefile.PL: readonly $lib fix for MSWin32
	* t/testc.sh: silence ulimit -m warnings + errors

1.39	2012-01-25 rurban
	* C: improved eval AUTOLOAD, avoid some POSIX and Storable .al compile-time
	  side-effects such as creating files and dirs. First try loading
	  .al files, only then eval the dangerous AUTOLOAD.
	* Makefile.PL: typo in -fav-init2 independent_comalloc detection.
	Added LICENSE key, META and the files were not enough to please pause.

1.38	2012-01-24 rurban
	* t/issue93.t: fixed syntax error

1.37	2012-01-24 rurban
	Enabled copy-on-grow strings >= 5.10.
	Save %main:: stashes w/o -fno-stash. Switched to git, added github mirror
	Fixed hashes and share_hek, when mixed compiled and load-time for >5.8.

	Stability: This release is the first which passes almost all tests and
	is used in production with --staticxs -O3, but copy-on-grow hek's and
	further logical improvements (deferred %INC cleanup) fail so far, so it's
	still considered unstable.

	* C: save stashes optionally with -fstash, but only values which are also
	  stashes to avoid a second walker besides savecv, and thus do not
	  walk into unneeded territory; B::STASHGV (46, issue 79)
	New -fno-stash with -O2 to omit stashes which are rarely needed.
	Fixed vulnerability to oCERT-2011-003 style DOS attacks. Do not
	  pre-compute hashes for hv_store(), use fresh random hash seed.
	  But shared_hek() has a limited API which does not allow this.
	UNIVERSAL methods were not correctly stored, which led to method not
	  found at run-time errors.
	New debug option -Dr "runtime" to add debug output to the .c code (as in CC)
	New option -Upackage to skip package, mark_skip()
	Re-implemented sharepvn via share_hek() and SvLEN=0 (issue 71),
	  Special FAKE+READONLY handling: LEN = 0 if pv_copy_on_grow or shared_hek.
	  Fixed !SvIsCOW_shared_hash + FAKE+READONLY conflict (test 13, issue 82).
	  Shared COW hashkeys which are optimized to static const strings
	  may not be marked as IsCOW (remove SVf_FAKE).
	Re-implemented CORE share_hek with hash=0
	  Otherwise shared HEK's (post-5.10) come up with duplicate entries
	  for the same keys; one compile-time created and one run-time created with
	  a different random hash seed. E.g. observed by such warnings
	  "Prototype mismatch: sub bytes::length (_) vs (_)"
	Added Internals::hv_clear_placeholders XS name exception, similar
	  to version:: (issue 83)
	Store CV prototypes, issue 81 and issue 84 for empty () vs NULL prototypes.
	Fixed 5.15.2 hang at hfree_next_entry (issue 78)
	Defer writing of READONLY hash keys since 5.15 (issue 88)
	Enable -fcog copy-on-grow with static strings for >= 5.10
	Improved Errno vs. *main::! and Tie::Hash::NamedCapture vs
	  *main::+  / - logic (issue 90)
	Updated version XS methods, default to noop for (...
	Strip version object overload from XS packages (issue 91), XS needs plain PVs
	Do not initialize CONSTSUB XS methods twice, boot does it for us
	Pass proper cv to XS boot_$name, fixes boot of
	  Tie::Hash::NamedCapture (issue 86)
	Fixed share_hek strings with -O1 (test 13)
	Fixed bootstrapping the XS/core part of attributes,
	  thereby fixed threads tests 41-43.
	Fixed most 5.8.[45] problems by ignoring aelemfast SPECIAL pads.
	Fixed magic -> PTR when SV (>5.6)
	Moved -fsave-sig-hash from -O3 to -O0. You need -fno-save-sig-hash
	  to disable it.
	Removed -fno-stash from -O2, -fno-stash is now the default. You
	  need -fstash to add stashes. It caused not understood problems.
	Fixed saving %SIG signals and more -2 SV magic (issue 92)
	Adjusted IO logic, was erronously skipped (issue 59)
	inc_cleanup: save only those %INC keys which are stored.
	Save ext/mro only if the ext mro methods were loaded, and
	  utf8_heavy.pl similarly.
	Force loading of -u arguments to avoid runtime loading.
	Call boot_core_PerlIO, mro, UNIVERSAL and xsutils.
	Warn on unsavable IO objects from BEGIN blocks.
	  Fixed >&STD... handles (issue 93),
	  i.e. Test::Builder, Test::NoWarnings and parts of the core testing.
	  See http://blogs.perl.org/users/rurban/2012/01/what-to-avoid-in-begin-blocks.html
	Add B::COP::stashflags workaround, >5.15.4 threaded.
	Add fix for lost PL_regex_pad, 5.15 threaded.
	* CC (1.12): allow overriding of -f<opt> B::C flags.
	Skip internal packages with mark_skip (fixes cc_o2 tests).
	Move -ftype-attr from -O2 to -O1.
	Always define int, double and string package versions, parallel to types.
	* Bytecode (1.12): detect Tie::Hash::NamedCapture (issue 90) -
	  works only partially.
	Fixed >&STD... handles (issue 93)
	Support -d debugging without -MOd
	* Stackobj (1.00_03): add UL or L to overlong integers. doubles
	  not yet
	* perlcc (2.13): added options -O[1-4], -u, -U, --Wc, --Wl, --version,
	Keep cfile if output is empty.
	Change -o output C file directory and name with -S or -c:
	  Before in current directory, now in -o directory.
	  Before with input name, now with -o name.
	Add -rpath for all --staticxs libs if supported.
	Changed verbosity levels and output wording.
	* bytecode.pl: added xio_ifp
	* bytecode.h: added BSET_xio_ifp
	* META.yml: remove from MANIFEST and repo, let make dist
	  autogenerate it.
	* t/test.pl, t/TESTS: changed test 46 (Exporter:: and other stashes in
	  %main:: stash) to cover issue 79.
	  use Exporter; print q(ok) if %main::Exporter::
	* t/test.pl: use general comments with optional TODO. Before only TODO
	* t/perldoc.t: fixed for 5.8 with manually adding -uFile::Spec -uIO::Handle
	* t/issue59.t, t/issue81.t, t/issue90.t, t/issue93.t: added

1.36	2011-10-19 rurban
	lexical warnings and more 5.15 fixes
	* C: new B::LEXWARN, fixed representation of lexical warnings which was broken
	  since 8e01d9a6  5.8.9/5.9.4 (issue 76)
	Added section free, use it for lexical cop_warnings (const STRLEN*)
	  (TODO: static PV, HEK + COPs)
	Workaround for utf8::SWASHNEW adjusted to 5.15
	PAD* sv flags changed in 5.15.3
	XSLoader API changed (HEK in caller i.e.): had to add a
	  XSLoader::load_file for [perl #101336] >= 5.15.3,
	  also use mXPUSH for sp instead of 1-arg targ
	Set SvLEN=0 for static PVs to skip sv_clear (problem with 13)
	Handle overlarge negative 64bit ints, double not yet.
	Move -fwarn-sv from -O2 to -O1
	Move -fsave-data from -O3 to -O2
	Compile *main::DATA IO handle automatically (__DATA__), just package __DATA__
	  handles need -fsave-data (15)
	Die with 5.8.4/5.8.5 threaded with split->pushre on invalid
	  pmreplroot. This is a core B::walkoptree bug and can not be
	  easily fixed.
	Tests 15 and 103 do not hang anymore, 15 and 29 pass mostly
	* C.xs: added -Dts support to runloop to check internal compiler
	  problems
	* t/issue76.t: added

	  stable. -O2 string handling (-fro-inc) still unstable.
	added B::REGEXP::save for \$qr (Encode::Alias), issue 71. Still
	  not fully fixed. Encode::Alias unusable.
	fixed empty HV assertions since 5.15, new HV default keys = 7
	  (3,4,36), but still unsolved 5.15 problem with endless loop in
	  Perl_hfree_next_entry hv.c:1716 (3,4,36)
	workaround 5.15.2 inability to walk with from %INC deleted
	  stashes, also workaround adding already deleted DynaLoader.

	* CC (1.11): allow debugging without -MOd=CC
	Try to jump from last to unknown label, put labels also onto cxstack.
	Fixed cc_last.t test 4, jump out of anonsub, but not across C
	  functions yet (this is disallowed in C, need to split).
	* C.xs: added B::REGEXP::EXTFLAGS (missing from B).
	* perlcc (2.12): omit also inc_version_list dirs from perlcc as
	  leaving them in could lead to unexpected crashes
	* t/cc_last.t: Fixed test 2. This works compiled and uncompiled,
	  but the returned errcode is not compared. Skip if so.
	* t/TESTS: add all 5 possible method/sub calls to test 35 =>01234.

1.04_30 2009-12-13 rurban
	Better 5.6 support, but Bytecode compiler still disabled.
	Not even the Byteloader works for 5.6 assembled code. The Disassembler
	does not stop at ret. Fixed several C tests.

	* bytecode.pl: renumbering policy: <= 5.6 squeeze, >= 5.8 fixed
	to force exact bytecode numbering as with 5.8.
	Allow float versions, such as 10.001 for subreleases.

	Add perlversion to header.
	Add byteorder check logic.

	Added logic to include all possible unsupported ops, all holes.
	bytecode table checked for 5.6.1, 5.6.2, 5.8.0, 5.8.1-5.11
	Note, that I found official and contradicting 5.6.1 releases.
	ActiveState 5.6.1.626 had no op_children, the unix release tarball
	with 5.6.1 (called Trial 1) still has it.

	* ByteLoader.pm (1.06_06): better bytecode numbering.
	* Asmdata.pm (1.02_02): strict numbering along 5.8.
	Unsupported ops are now also included, with PUT method 0.

	* Disassembler.pm (1.05_04): Add perlversion to header.
	Print header only for existing.
	* BcVersions/Asm*.pm, BcVersions.pod: added for most versions with the
	CORE compiler.
	* disassemble: Make it work with the older Disassembler.
	Make it work with older bytecode >= 5.8 via Asmdata unsupported ops.
	* i386.xs, jitcompiler.pl: removed (seperate module)
	* bytecode.h, C.xs: Fixed for 5.6, tested with 5.6.1 with MSVC.
	* bytecode.h, byterun.c: add static int force = 0. Override it to 1 to
	try out executing older bytecodes.

	* C.pm: fix test 16 on 5.10 again, non-threaded only (GVAV magic).
	  first fix in 1.04_24, broken in 1.04_28. On 5.11 I have a broken
	  RV handling here.
	Remove version and Regexp::DESTROY from the automatic methods
	(experimental).
	First attempts with pv and hek consting failed.
	* t/testc.sh, t/testplc.sh: support proper cmdline arguments, add -h for
	help
	Fixed test 5 by fixing the wrong test.
	* perloptree.pod: renamed from perloptreeguts.pod. Added links.

1.04_29 2009-12-07 rurban
	Disable the Bytecode compiler for 5.6. Fixed besides the __DATA__ handle
	  (test 15) all remaining 5.8 C bugs.
	* C.pm: assign the PVX of GV also for empty stashes (main::) to avoid
	  destruction failures at Perl_pad_undef() SvPVX_const(namesv) == '&'.
	Fixes tests 14 and 23
	* byterun.c: No assert on empty bs_sv, it is &PL_sv_undef.
	Map missing -Dv on 5.6 to -Df i.e. -D256
	Added better debugging output: setter values.
	* STATUS: re-run CORE tests, list cmdlines, update status
	* Disassembler.pm: added gen_header_hash() for gen_header output.
	  add to documentation.
	* Bytecode.pm: -S uses gen_header_hash for gen_header output.

1.04_28 2009-12-06 rurban
	* C.pm: fix -fcog (Copy on Grow with -O1 and -O2) for >= 5.10 by a new
	  SVPV.
	Statically initialize PVs with a union layout trick. Use char* as first
	  union member.
	Revert xpvcv+svsect changes to pre-initialize those structs against
	  gvcv recursion.
	* t/b.t, t/o.t, t/stash.t: fix tests for 5.6.2
	* bytecode.c: byteorder swab only if same length.
	1234 => 4321, 12345678 => 87654321.
	Skip a 0x prefix for byteorder in the header. Perl 5.6 had this.
	* Assembler.pm (0.07_06): 5.6 byteorder fix: until 5.6 the
	  $Config{byteorder} was falsely dependent on ivsize, we need longsize.
	Add 0x to byteorder in header again, as with 5.6.
	* t/testc.sh: do not run old leftovers. some 5.6 optimizations
	* t/c_o1.t, t/c_o2.t, t/cc_o2.t, t/cc_o2.t: added

    bytecode.pl:	Exterminate!
    ext/B/B/Asmdata.pm: Exterminate!

Nicholas Clark <nwc10+p5p4@colon.colondot.net>	2007-05-07 14:53:05
    Given that @optype and @specialsv_name are hard coded tables, it seems
    more logical for them to be in B.pm, rather than in the "boilerplate"
    for the machine generated B/Asmdata.pm

    @2461 1. Fixes the bug  reported by	 Robin Barker <rmb1@cise.npl.co.uk>
    2. Fixes the bug  regarding return value of c-functions generated out
    of perl subs. ( Just includes the patch I sent earlier)
    3. Incorporates the other changes that need to be done to get CC.pm
    use ISA search for packages and methods on the same lines as C.pm

    Vishal would appreciate comments about B::Stackobj changes from
    someone knowing that module well.

    @2453 Avoid hard-coding op numbers
    Update CC.pm to save %INC, and to co-exist with new C.pm

Nick Ing-Simmons <nik@tiuk.ti.com>  1998-12-05 11:44:28
    @2452 B.xs had its own code to calculate hash() which differed from
    PERL_HASH in hv.h - so all saved HV's were mangled - including %INC
    which meant that run-time require was re-done.
    Removed some debug from C.pm

Nick Ing-Simmons <nik@tiuk.ti.com>  1998-12-04 22:58:49
    @2451 Snapshot of re-worked B::C which compiles Tk apps at least as
    well as _54, but with pre-scan for classes and save the ISA scheme.

Nick Ing-Simmons <nik@tiuk.ti.com>  1998-11-28 23:46:57
    @2378 More C.pm tweaks
      Save globs even if we have saved cv itself before - may be imported.

      While we don't save "bootstrap" CV we need to provide a stub,
      so that if we require it later we don't fall through and attempt
      to DynaLoad module again.

      Attempt to save %INC so that "require" does not reload things
      we have compiled-in (does not work right yet - seems to be due
      to PL_incgv being created in perl_parse() current scheme setting
      GvHV() is "better" than saving the glob, but still does not
      work as I expect).

Nick Ing-Simmons <nik@tiuk.ti.com>  1998-11-27 22:10:27
    @2332 Handle INIT list in C.pm
    1. Provide init_av() from B.xs
    2. Export it in B.pm
    3. Use it in C.pm
    Also disable some pruning in savecv() which seems to undo
    my previous patch.
    Experimental feature - save pathnames of .so files in easily
    grep-able form for use in wrapper to feed to linker.

    @589 [win32] various cleanups so that B can be built as "just another extension"
     - export symbols needed for building B
     - bset_obj_store() is needed by byterun(), so define it there instead
       of at B.xs, and export it
     - freadpv() is only used in B.xs, so move it there
     - byte*.h are now included by perl.h
     - regenerate embed*.h

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 16:42:13

	* Merge perlext/Compiler/... into mainline. Some files move to
    ext/B/..., some to lib/B/..., O.pm and B.pm go in lib and some
    move to the base perl directory (e.g. headers). Will need some
    cleaning up before it builds properly, I would guess.
