On what operating system?\u003c/b\u003e\nperl 5.12.0 and perl 5.12.1\n\n\u003cb\u003ePlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/b\u003e\nIt seems to me that Perl_store_cop_label does not appear in perl source global.sym file which enlists all exported functions, so it is not exported from perl512.dll as well (perldll.ref is created from the symbol files).\nI have just insert this entry to global.sym in perl 5.12.1 source, recompiled everything and after that the B::C install was perfect.","files":null}]}
